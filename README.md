# Document Indexer: Scalable Search and Ranking Demo

This project demonstrates how to ingest, index, and search a collection of documents in pure Python using industry-standard ranking algorithms, TF-IDF and BM25, that underpin major search engines like Elasticsearch, Solr, and OpenSearch.

It serves both as a learning resource and a modular foundation for scaling up to distributed, cloud-native, or production IR systems.
